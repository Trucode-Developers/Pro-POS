Just added permissions to roles 

next-steps: 
1. fetch all roles and display under the user when updating user 
2. get allocated roles  for a user and check them when modal is open
3. when saving user update , pass the array of roles to the backend
4. update the user roles in the backend


//login 
1. create a login page
2. when user passes in the correct credentials, check the user roles in user_roles table
3. for now we can save to local storage and use it to authenticate the user, get authed id , then get the roles for the user
4. note you will get an array of roles for a user get permission slugs for each role and concatinate them
use get_allocated_permission_slugs function thats already created
