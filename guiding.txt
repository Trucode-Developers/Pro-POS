Just added permissions to roles 



//login 
1. create a login page
2. when user passes in the correct credentials, check the user roles in user_roles table
3. we already have a function that gets  permission slugs, so create a login function that gets the permission slugs and stores them in the session
by passing in the user id to the function

0= postgres://postgres:Server@2244@localhost/pos // database url
1= postgres //database type

CONNECTING TWO LAPTOPS/COMPUTERS ON THE SAME NETWORK

// connect both the laptops/computers on the same network
// remember we user 129.168.0.0 for wireless connection and 192.168.1.0 for wired connection. Though this ight change over time 

Windows as the server
//install the postgres, set password , get port and add db name eg: pos
//our final target will be : postgres://postgres:Server@2244@192.168.0.105:5433/pos

Configure PostgreSQL to allow remote connections
// Open the PostgreSQL configuration file postgresql.conf. The default location is C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\x.x\data\postgresql.conf (replace x.x with your PostgreSQL version).
// find and edit: 
listen_addresses = '*'


Configure PostgreSQL to allow connections from other computers
// Open the pg_hba.conf file. The default location is C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\x.x\data\pg_hba.conf (replace x.x with your PostgreSQL version).
// Find the line that starts with # IPv4 local connections:. 
host    all             all             192.168.1.0/24            md5 // on enthernet connection
host    all             all             192.168.0.0/24            md5 //under wifi


Restart the PostgreSQL server:
// Open the Services app (press the Windows key and search for "Services").
// Find the "PostgreSQL" service in the list.
// Right-click on the service and select "Restart".

Allowing port through Windows defender, Open the PostgreSQL server's firewall:
// Press the Windows key and search for "Windows Defender Firewall".
// Open the "Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security" app.
// In the left panel, click on "Inbound Rules".
// Click on "New Rule" in the right panel.
// Select "Port" as the rule type and click "Next".
// Select "TCP" as the protocol, and enter "5432" in the "Specific local ports" field. This is the default port that PostgreSQL listens on.
// Click "Next" and select "Allow the connection".
// Click "Next" and ensure that the rule applies to all profiles (Domain, Private, and Public).
// Provide a name for the rule, such as "PostgreSQL Server", and click "Finish".


//The final expected output should be:
postgres://postgres:Server@2244@192.168.0.105:5433/pos
